PROMPT 1
Briefly describe the context for the visual by addressing the following questions:

1. What is the source of the visual? (e.g., URL or bibliographic citation)
2. Who is the intended audience (i.e., decoders)? How do you know this?

SOLUTION 1
1. https:/viz.wtf/post/171134950336/just-a-sliver-please

2. The intended audience are directly the customers, the common people, to whom this device is useful.
It describes the customers about the uses of google home which will help them, by reducing small small works they will be doing.
Majority music lovers, people who are a bit lazy are directly targeted

PROMPT 2
1. Identify the specific component(s) of the visual that is/are misleading
2. For each part(s) of the visualization that is/are misleading, identify the mechanism that is used: hiding relevant data to highlight what benefits us; displaying too much data to obscure reality; using graphic forms in inappropriate ways (distorting the data)
3. Explain how the mechanisms are used to mislead

SOLUTION 2
1.1 One of component of visual that is misleading are that the number of factors that are being described in the pie chart.

1.2 The mechanism is that, Displaying too much data to obscure reality.

1.3 The problem is that, the audience cannot properly understand all the benefits of google home, They are able to identify only the majority parts, that might not be their prior requirement, thus they may think that this product is not useful to them.

2.1 Another misleading part is the shape of the pie chart, which is a 3-d structure, and it's inappropriate sizing of the areas.

2.2 The mechanism here is Using graphic forms in an inappropriate manner.

2.3 The standard way of representing a pie chart should be in two dimensional, not three dimensional, which will be pretty misleading by showing only some part of the data, showing less area to a more widely used operation and vice versa.
